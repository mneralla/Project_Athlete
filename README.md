# Project_Athlete
This website was created to allow people to explore our analysis of the incomes from the top paid athletes around the world from 1990-2019. D3 and plotly helped build the visualizations, and flask was used to run the site. HTML and CSS/Bootstrap was used for the styling of the website. The app is hosted in Heroku.

We wanted to visualize the top earners per year, and decided that was was best demonstrated by a bar graph. There are also filters to change it top earning countries or sports.

To show top individual earners, the team built a bubble graph that varied in size depending on income that year.

The team also wanted to visualize earnings and income by country, so we built a map with markers and tooltips to display geographical earnings.
